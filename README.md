# RevBayes Workshop: Phylogenetic graphical models and Bayesian inference
### UC Berkeley, VLSB 1002
### February 26-27 2018, 12:00 PM to 4:00 PM
### Instructor: Will Freyman <http://willfreyman.org>
### Coordinator: Carrie Tribble <https://carrietribble.weebly.com/>

[RevBayes](http://revbayes.com) represents a fundamental re-conception of phylogenetic modeling by adopting a graphical model framework in
which all probabilistic models are comprised of modular components that can be assembled in a myriad of ways. 
The graphical models are specified using a highly flexible R-like language, `Rev`. 

This workshop will focus on enabling participants to use `Rev` to specify custom arbitrarily complex phylogenetic models from simple component parts. 
Instruction will combine short lectures introducing the theoretical and conceptual basis of each inference problem and hands-on computer tutorials 
demonstrating how to explore these questions using [RevBayes](http://revbayes.com). 
Previous experience with [RevBayes](http://revbayes.com) is not necessary, though familiarity with phylogenetic inference using other software is expected.

This workshop is open to anyone interested, including students, staff, post-docs, and faculty from IB and beyond.
